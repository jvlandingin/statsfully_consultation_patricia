# Study Framework: Tax Structure and SDG Outcomes in Asia-Pacific

## Executive Summary

This study examines how **tax structure composition** (the balance between income/profit taxes and consumption taxes) affects **health (SDG 3)** and **education (SDG 4)** outcomes across 29 Asia-Pacific economies from 2014-2023, while considering moderating effects of macroeconomic factors.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Research Questions

### Main Research Question

> **How does the composition of tax structures affect health (SDG 3) and education (SDG 4) outcomes among Asia-Pacific economies, considering the moderating effects of population, GDP per capita, and debt-to-GDP ratio?**

### Specific Research Questions

1.  **Direct Relationship**: How is tax structure (income-predominant, consumption-predominant, or balanced) significantly related to health (SDG 3) and education (SDG 4) outcomes?

2.  **Comparative Analysis**: How do countries with different predominant tax compositions vary in their health and education outcomes?

3.  **Population Moderation**: How does population size affect the relationship between tax structure and SDG outcomes?

4.  **GDP Per Capita Moderation**: How does GDP per capita affect the relationship between tax structure and SDG outcomes?

5.  **Debt-to-GDP Moderation**: How does debt-to-GDP ratio affect the relationship between tax structure and SDG outcomes?

## Analytical Framework

### Stage 1: Composite Index Construction (PCA)

Create composite indices for SDG 3 and SDG 4 using Principal Component Analysis:

1.  **Standardization**: Z-score transformation of all indicators

    ```         
    Z = (X - μ) / σ
    ```

2.  **Reverse Coding**: Indicators where lower = better (mortality rates, pupil-teacher ratio) are reversed

    ```         
    Reversed = Max(X) - X + Min(X)
    ```

3.  **PCA Extraction**: Extract principal components explaining maximum variance

4.  **Index Calculation**: Weighted sum using factor loadings as weights

### Stage 2: Diagnostic Testing

| Test | Purpose | Decision Rule |
|-----------------|---------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)** | Multicollinearity | VIF \< 10 acceptable |
| **Breusch-Pagan Test** | Heteroscedasticity | p \< 0.05 → heteroscedasticity present |
| **Wooldridge Test** | Autocorrelation | p \< 0.05 → autocorrelation present |
| **Pesaran CD Test** | Cross-sectional dependence | p \< 0.05 → CD present |
| **Unit Root Tests** | Stationarity | p \< 0.05 → stationary |

### Stage 3: Model Selection

| Test                 | Comparison                      | Decision Rule      |
|-----------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Breusch-Pagan LM** | Pooled OLS vs Random Effects    | p \< 0.05 → use RE |
| **Chow F-Test**      | Pooled OLS vs Fixed Effects     | p \< 0.05 → use FE |
| **Hausman Test**     | Fixed Effects vs Random Effects | p \< 0.05 → use FE |

### Stage 4: Panel Regression Models

#### Base Model (Direct Effects)

**Fixed Effects:**

```         
SDGᵢₜ = αᵢ + β₁(IncomeTax)ᵢₜ + β₂(ConsumptionTax)ᵢₜ + εᵢₜ
```

**Random Effects:**

```         
SDGᵢₜ = α + β₁(IncomeTax)ᵢₜ + β₂(ConsumptionTax)ᵢₜ + μᵢ + εᵢₜ
```

#### Full Model (With Moderators)

**Fixed Effects:**

```         
SDGᵢₜ = αᵢ + β₁(IncomeTax)ᵢₜ + β₂(ConsumptionTax)ᵢₜ
        + β₃(Population)ᵢₜ + β₄(GDPpc)ᵢₜ + β₅(DebtGDP)ᵢₜ
        + β₆(IncomeTax × Population)ᵢₜ
        + β₇(IncomeTax × GDPpc)ᵢₜ
        + β₈(IncomeTax × DebtGDP)ᵢₜ
        + β₉(ConsumptionTax × Population)ᵢₜ
        + β₁₀(ConsumptionTax × GDPpc)ᵢₜ
        + β₁₁(ConsumptionTax × DebtGDP)ᵢₜ + εᵢₜ
```

**Random Effects:**

```         
SDGᵢₜ = α + β₁(IncomeTax)ᵢₜ + β₂(ConsumptionTax)ᵢₜ
        + β₃(Population)ᵢₜ + β₄(GDPpc)ᵢₜ + β₅(DebtGDP)ᵢₜ
        + β₆(IncomeTax × Population)ᵢₜ
        + β₇(IncomeTax × GDPpc)ᵢₜ
        + β₈(IncomeTax × DebtGDP)ᵢₜ
        + β₉(ConsumptionTax × Population)ᵢₜ
        + β₁₀(ConsumptionTax × GDPpc)ᵢₜ
        + β₁₁(ConsumptionTax × DebtGDP)ᵢₜ + μᵢ + εᵢₜ
```

Where: - `i` = country - `t` = year - `αᵢ` = country-specific fixed effect - `μᵢ` = random effect (country-specific error component) - `εᵢₜ` = idiosyncratic error term

### Stage 5: Robustness Checks

1.  **Robust Standard Errors**: Cluster-robust SE for heteroscedasticity/autocorrelation
2.  **Alternative Specifications**: Test with lagged independent variables
3.  **Sensitivity Analysis**: Test different threshold values (5%, 15%) for tax classification

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Expected Theoretical Relationships

### Income-Predominant Tax Systems

-   **Progressive taxation** → More redistributive capacity
-   **Higher earners taxed more** → Greater government revenue for social spending
-   **Expected**: Better health and education outcomes

### Consumption-Predominant Tax Systems

-   **Regressive taxation** → Disproportionate burden on lower-income households
-   **Broad-based but less redistributive** → Less funding for public services
-   **Expected**: Weaker health and education outcomes

### Moderating Effects

-   **Population**: Larger populations may dilute per-capita benefits
-   **GDP Per Capita**: Wealthier nations may have stronger tax-outcome relationships
-   **Debt-to-GDP**: High debt may constrain social spending regardless of tax structure

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Statistical Software

-   **R**: Primary analysis environment
-   **Packages**: `plm` (panel models), `lmtest` (diagnostics), `sandwich` (robust SE), `psych` (PCA)
