## Who I Am

I'm a data scientist with over 6 years of experience helping organizations make sense of complex data. I've worked with multinational companies across healthcare, market research, and finance—building predictive models, automating data pipelines, and turning raw numbers into actionable insights.

I'm currently pursuing my PhD in Data Science at the University of the Philippines Diliman, where I also completed my Professional Master's in Data Science and Analytics. Before that, I earned a Professional Certificate in Data Science from Harvard University.

For five years, I ran **Statsfully**, a statistical consulting practice where I helped students and researchers with thesis analysis, research methodology, and data interpretation. That experience taught me how to translate complex statistical concepts into language that makes sense—and how to guide people through the often-stressful thesis process.

### Professional Experience

**Data Scientist \| Theoria Medical PLLC** (USA, Remote) *June 2023 – Present*

I work with a healthcare company managing over 200 medical facilities across the United States. My role involves building AI-powered systems for treatment planning, creating predictive models for staffing optimization, and developing automated data pipelines. This work requires handling complex, real-world data where accuracy directly impacts patient care.

**Statistical Data Scientist \| GfK** *December 2021 – June 2023*

At GfK, a global market research firm, I analyzed consumer electronics data across the Asia-Pacific region. I worked with multi-country datasets and cross-national analysis. I also trained colleagues on R Shiny for interactive data visualization and developed fraud detection systems for survey data.

**Content Analyst \| London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) - Refinitiv** *June 2019 – December 2021*

I processed and validated financial data for one of the world's largest financial data providers. This role sharpened my attention to data quality and accuracy—skills that matter when working with secondary data.

**Founder \| Statsfully** *February 2019 – December 2023*

I ran my own statistical consulting practice, helping undergraduate and graduate students with their thesis research. I've guided dozens of students through methodology design, statistical analysis, and results interpretation. I understand the thesis process from the student's perspective.

Statistical jargon can be intimidating. I break down complex concepts into understandable terms. My goal isn't just to run numbers—it's to make sure you understand what those numbers mean so you can confidently present and defend your work.
