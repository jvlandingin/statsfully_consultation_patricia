**Subject:** Re: Statistical Consultation for Your Thesis - Quote & Next Steps

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi Patricia,

Thank you for reaching out and for sharing your thesis proposal. I've had a chance to review it, and I'm impressed with the scope of your research. Examining the relationship between tax structure and SDG outcomes across 29 Asia-Pacific countries is an ambitious and relevant topic.

I've prepared a detailed quote and scope of services for your group. Please see the attached document:

-   **Project Quote** – outlines the service packages, pricing, timeline, and next steps

**A note on pricing:**

When you first inquired, I initially estimated the cost to be around PHP 4,000-6,000. However, after reviewing your proposal in detail, I realized the methodology is more complex than a typical undergraduate thesis. It involves panel data regression, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), moderation analysis with multiple interaction terms, and a comprehensive suite of diagnostic tests.

That said, the prices I quoted are negotiable. We can adjust the scope and cost depending on which areas you actually need help with. I've included four options in the quote:

-   **Option A (PHP 500/hr):** Hourly consultation if you want to do the analysis yourselves but need guidance

-   **Option B (PHP 5,000-7,000):** Partial assistance if you only need help with specific parts (e.g., just the PCA or just the panel regression)

-   **Option C (PHP 10,000):** Full statistical analysis package

-   **Option D (PHP 15,000):** Comprehensive end-to-end support

Let me know what works best for your group and your budget. I'm happy to hop on a quick call to discuss further.

**Next steps:**

1.  Review the attached quote
2.  Let me know which package or approach interests you
3.  Send over your compiled dataset (if available) so I can do a quick assessment
4.  We can schedule a brief call to finalize the details

Looking forward to working with you!

Best regards,
