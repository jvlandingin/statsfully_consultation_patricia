# Talking Points: Initial Client Meeting

## Patricia Pao Group - Thesis Consultation

---

## Opening

### Introduction
-   "Hi, I'm Vince. Thanks for reaching out about your thesis."
-   Brief mention: PhD candidate at UP Diliman, 6+ years as professional Data Scientist
-   "I've reviewed your proposal—it's an interesting research question."

### Build Rapport
-   Ask about their timeline and defense schedule
-   Ask which member is handling the statistical analysis
-   Ask about their comfort level with statistics software (Stata, R, SPSS?)

---

## Demonstrate Understanding of Their Project

### Show You've Done Your Homework
-   "Your study looks at how tax structure—specifically the balance between income taxes and consumption taxes—affects health and education outcomes across 29 Asia-Pacific countries."
-   "You're using panel data from 2014 to 2023, so that's 10 years of data."
-   "The methodology involves PCA for creating composite indices, panel regression with fixed or random effects, and moderation analysis."

### Acknowledge Complexity
-   "This is a sophisticated methodology for an undergraduate thesis—panel data econometrics with moderation effects isn't trivial."
-   "The good news is your proposal shows solid understanding of the statistical framework."

## Key Observations to Share

### Strengths of Their Proposal
1.  Comprehensive diagnostic testing plan (VIF, Breusch-Pagan, Wooldridge, Pesaran)
2.  Sound model selection approach (Hausman, Chow, BP-LM tests)
3.  Clear variable operationalization

### Areas That Need Attention (Position as Helpful, Not Critical)
1.  **Time Lags:** "One thing to consider—tax policy changes don't affect health and education outcomes immediately. You might want to use lagged variables, like testing if tax structure in 2020 affects SDG outcomes in 2022."

2.  **Endogeneity:** "There's a question of which comes first—does tax policy cause better outcomes, or do richer countries with better outcomes simply have different tax systems? We should discuss how to address this."

3.  **Country Differences:** "Japan and Cambodia have very different economic contexts. The same tax policy might work differently in each. We might want to look at subgroup analysis."

*Frame these as: "These are things your panel might ask about during defense—let's make sure you're prepared."*

## Transition to Services

### Gauge Their Needs
-   "What kind of help are you looking for? Do you want guidance while you do the analysis, or do you need someone to run the statistical tests?"
-   "How much time do you have before your deadline?"
-   "Have you already compiled your data, or is that still in progress?"

### Present Options (Don't Lead with Price)
-   "I offer a few different ways we can work together..."
-   Briefly describe the three options:
    -   Consultation: hourly guidance
    -   Statistical Analysis: I run the core analysis
    -   Comprehensive: end-to-end support

### Handle Price Questions
-   If they ask for rates upfront: "It depends on the scope, but for a project like this, it typically ranges from PHP 10,000 to 20,000 for full statistical support. Hourly consultation is PHP 500-800."
-   If they seem hesitant: "I understand budget can be tight for students. What's your comfortable range? We can tailor the scope."

## Common Questions to Anticipate

### "Why are you qualified for this?"
-   PhD candidate in Data Science at UP Diliman
-   Masters in Data Science and Analytics from UP Diliman
-   Harvard Professional Certificate in Data Science
-   6+ years working as a Data Scientist at multinational companies (GfK, Theoria Medical, LSEG)
-   Ran my own statistical consulting practice for 5 years (Statsfully)
-   Worked on APAC multi-country analysis at GfK—directly relevant to your thesis scope

### "Can you guarantee we'll pass?"
-   "I can't guarantee outcomes, but I can guarantee the statistical work will be done correctly and rigorously. The methodology will hold up to scrutiny."
-   "I'll also help you understand the results so you can defend them confidently."

### "How long will it take?"
-   "For comprehensive support, typically 7-11 working days once I receive your data."
-   "Consultation-only depends on how often we meet."

### "What software do you use?"
-   "I primarily use R, but I can also work with Stata output if that's what your department prefers."
-   "I'll provide you with the code and output files so you can replicate the analysis."

### "What if our panel asks us questions about the methodology?"
-   "Part of my service includes making sure you understand the analysis. I'll walk you through every step so you can explain it during your defense."

## Closing the Meeting

### Summarize Next Steps
1.  "Send me your compiled dataset so I can do a quick assessment."
2.  "Let me know which package you're interested in."
3.  "Once confirmed, I'll send a simple agreement and we can get started."

### Create Gentle Urgency
-   "When is your target defense date? Let's work backward from there to make sure we have enough time."

### Leave the Door Open
-   "Take your time to discuss with your groupmates. Feel free to message me if you have more questions."
-   "I'll send you a summary of what we discussed along with the formal quote."

1.  Send thank-you message within 24 hours
2.  Attach the client quote document
3.  Attach consultant profile for their reference
4.  Ask for their dataset for preliminary review
5.  Set a soft deadline for their decision
